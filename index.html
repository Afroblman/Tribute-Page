            <h2 class="heading-center">Childhood and Early Life</h2>
            <p>Ejigayehu Shibabaw was born in 1974 in Chagni, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. She belongs to the prestigious
              “Shibabaw” family, which bears children who are stars in Ethiopia. Gigi is the fifth child in a family of ten. 
              Ejigayehu Shibabaw was raised by upright parents who led their life by coffee gowing. Her family's survival was
              reliant on the river Ardi's water to irrigate their coffee plantations.</p>
            <p>Gigi grew up singing in the Ethiopian Church, and it was from a priest that she learned how to sing a song. 
              While Gigi grew up in her hometown, she used to listen to traditional and church music.</p>
            <p>At the age of 14, Gigi and her family moved to Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Accordingly, her
              musical horizons broadened as she heard local pop music, American music, a lot of West African music, South
              African music, hip hop, and anything else she could get on the radio. Egigayehu Shibabaw decided to become 
              a singer and songwriter at a very early age. However, it wasn't easy for her to pursue her dream, as she faced
              opposition from her tradition-minded parents. This prompted her to depart from Ethiopia and travel to neighboring
              Kenya, where she established a band and performed for the first time in 1993 at the age of 19 in Nairobi. After 
              her time in Kenya, Gigi moved back to Addis Ababa, where she quickly made a name for herself as a talented singer
              and songwriter.</p>

              <h2 class="heading-center">Music Career</h2>
              <p>Egigayehu Shibabaw started out as a singer with the National Theatre in Addis Ababa before making her
              first album,after she got back from Kenya. She met the musicians Weres Egziabeher and Fantahun Shewankochew there, and the three of 
              them went on tour together through East and South Africa and some parts of Europe.In France, Gigi got involved in a French theater 
              production of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Later on, she was invited to perform at a Paris world music festival called Imagineer and
              recorded a live concert. This marked her rise to stardom in Ethiopia.
              There, Gigi started recording her album was issued by the firm in France under the name “ÉTHIOPIE/Chants d'Amour.”
              Gigi also released her album, “Tsehay,” in the same year (the Sun).
              Gigi immigrated to America in 1998. She made her home in California and began working on her debut album with Dereje
               Mekonen. Each of the album's ten tracks was written by Gigi, who also sang them with her seductive voice. Many 
               Ethiopians became familiar with and adored Gigi as a result of the album One Ethiopia. Gigi has been recognized 
               as one of the most innovative and talented musicians in the business because of the lyrics' power and message, 
               their originality, and the melody's cultural suitability. She meets the well-known musician Bill Laswell after 
               Chris Blackwell of Palm Pictures notices the record. Bill assembled an excellent ensemble of accomplished
               musicians to create the album Gigi and Guramyale (mixed). The record, which was widely praised in 2001, ended up
               being the pinnacle of Gigi's musical career. The album combined elements from jazz, funk, Africa, and Asia. It is still
               regarded as a pinnacle of African and Ethiopian music. The voice of Gigi can be heard in the 2003 Hollywood film
               Beyond Borders, which stars Angelina Jolie as a relief worker in Ethiopia during the famine of 1984-1985.
